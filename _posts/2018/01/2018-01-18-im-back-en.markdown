Hi guys. I am writing this first post to tell you I'm back to share some technical stuff and, for this reason, I am remaking both my personal site and the [Hack N' Roll](http://www.hacknroll.io) one. Once the new layout is done (maybe the same of this site, because I'm not good with HTML+CSS), I will migrate the posts from the [old site](http://www.hacknroll.com) to the new one.

In this personal page, I intend to provide some material related to:
- Some research result
- Some talks I gave
- Methodology and study material
- Some interesting tool I write
- Tips and tricks related to InfoSec (OffSec, okay? haha)

As some people that know me already know, this site will have material related to the following subjects:
- General offensive security techniques
- Memory corruption exploitation stuff
- Protection bypass
- Software reverse engineering
- Hardware/embedded hacking and reverse engineering
- Lockpicking
- Web application hacking
- Vulnerability reports
- Information about personal projects related to InfoSec and the Hack N' Roll
- Bug Bounty ('cause "Talk is cheap! Show me the money...")
- etc

Unfortunately, the main language of this site will be Brazilian Portuguese. But I will try to rewrite all posts to English as fast I can. Feel free to send me any feedback about the content of this site, including subject, typos, misspelling etc.

Let's hack!<br />
